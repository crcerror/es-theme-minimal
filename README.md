**Words from the author**

> This theme is an attempt at making EmulationStation look more like a game system.

> Modern Game Systems (PS4, Xbox One, Switch, etc.) deliver a very specific experience compared to a computer. You turn it on, see a simple boot screen, and are in the menu in seconds. You know what you are getting in to. It's made abundantly clear that this is a video game machine. The games are front and center, and everything is wrapped up in a clean, minimal, interface...

> That is what I believe sets a game system apart from the Raspberry Pi. Sure, the interface is fast, and somewhat nice looking. But it doesn't feel like a video game system. This is where the Minimal theme steps in.
